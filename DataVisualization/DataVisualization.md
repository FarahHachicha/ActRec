**Dataset D2 Visualization**

This folder contains two files for visualizing Dataset D2, which comprises projects that have at least two actions.

__Boxplot.pdf__: This file displays a boxplot representing the distribution of actions for the projects in Dataset D2. The boxplot shows that the median number of actions for these projects is 3. This means that 50% of the projects utilize at least 3 actions, while the remaining 50% of projects use two or fewer actions. The boxplot also indicates that the third quartile (Q3) is equal to 5. This means that 75% of the projects use 5 actions or fewer.
In the boxplot, the outliers represent projects that use a higher number of actions compared to the majority of projects in the dataset. Specifically, projects that utilize 10 or more actions are considered outliers. 

__Histogram.pdf__: This file contains a histogram that visualizes the distribution of projects based on the number of actions they use. The histogram provides insights into the number of projects using 2 and 3 actions, as well as the number of projects using 4 and 5 actions. It also highlights the count of projects that contain more than 5 actions.

By visualizing Dataset D2 with these figures, we gain valuable insights into the distribution and usage patterns of actions across projects.
